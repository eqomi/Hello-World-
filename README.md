# Hello-World-
My First Repository
My name is Ellie. I migrated from Iran to U.S. 4 years ago. I studied Economics back in Iran and I just started my master in Data Analytics program in January 2019. I am a goal digger and I work hard to stablish my life here in U.S. If I could find spare time, I would do paintings because I am so passinate about it. I love travelling and my goal is to see as many places as possible in life.
