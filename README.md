# Hello-World-
My First Repository
My name is Ellie. I migrated from Iran to U.S. 4 years ago. I studied Economics back in Iran and I just started my master in Data Analytics program in January 2019. I am so interested in Data Science and I am ready to learn about it. 
I love travelling and my goal is to see as many new countries as I can in my life.
